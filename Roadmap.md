> INDE 6372 - Advanced Linear Optimization (3.0)
Operations research models with applications to engineering systems; mathematical programming; stochastic models of queueing and inventory.

> INDE 6333 - Probability Stat For Engineers (3.0)
Probability triplet, fundamental laws, conditioning probability, discrete and continuous random variables, point estimation, confidence interval estimation, hypothesis testing.

> INDE 6365 - Engineering Economy II (3.0)
Advanced theory, problems, and cases in the economic aspects of engineering enterprises. Operations research techniques applied to problems in engineering economy.

> INDE 6334 - Predictive Data Analytics (3.0)
A predictive analytics course focuses on principles, techniques and applications of predictive data analytics, designed mainly for graduate students who have basic knowledge of statistics. It primarily focuses on the ideas, algorithms implementations and applications of predictive data analytics methods and how to leverage them for analytic decision makings in practice. Predictive data analytics methods including regression, classification and mode evaluation will be studied. Programming using R will be taught and data analysis examples in R will be mentioned and demonstrated. Lab sessions on R programming will be offered.

> INDE 7390 - Supply Chain Management (3.0)
inventory and risk pooling, networking planning, value of information, supply chain integration, distribution strategies, strategic alliances, procurement and outsourcing strategies, global logics and risk management.

> INDE 6351 - Operations and Supply Chain Managament (3.0)
Theoretical and quantitative concepts, models, methods, and strategies for designing and managing manufacturing and service systems include quality, inventory, forecasting, scheduling, and logistics.

> INDE 7344 - Decision Modeling and Optimization (3.0)
The goal of this course is to introduce dynamic decision making under uncertainty. We will examine this problem within the Markov Decision Process framework (MDP). MDPs have applications in many areas including supply chain (e.g., inventory, maintenance), revenue management (e.g., hotel, airline, and rental car pricing), financial engineering, manufacturing, and medical decision making. The course will examine the models, theory, and applications of MDPs and their variants (e.g., partially observable MDP, model-free reinforcement learning).

> INDE 7342 - Nonlinear Optimization (3.0)
Nonlinear programming theory and algorithms; convex sets and convex functions; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions; algorithms for unconstrained and constrained optimization models.
